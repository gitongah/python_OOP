# Python Object-Oriented Programming


The object-oriented programming (OOP) features in Python make it easier to build programs of increasing complexity and modularity. We are going to learn how to apply core OOP principles to build programs that are extensible and efficient. We are going to start with the basics of defining and using classes and objects. Then he moves into more advanced features like abstract base classes and how to implement interfaces.we are going to look into details some of the more unique features of Python, like magic class methods to make your classes integrate tightly with the Python language and data classes to dramatically reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to build data-centric objects.
